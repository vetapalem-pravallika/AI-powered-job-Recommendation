# AI-Powered Job Recommendation System

An intelligent job recommendation system built using machine learning and large language models to match users to suitable jobs based on their resumes.

## 📌 Overview

This project uses NLP and AI to parse resumes, analyze skills, and recommend relevant job roles. It leverages pre-trained language models and job-matching algorithms to enhance career suggestions.

## 🔍 Features

- ✅ Resume parsing using NLP
- ✅ Job role prediction using skill analysis
- ✅ Matching algorithm based on cosine similarity or semantic embedding
- ✅ Streamlit-based interactive UI (optional for deployment)
- ✅ Works with datasets of job titles, descriptions, and skills

## 📁 Files

- `my_ai_project.ipynb`: Main notebook with all code
- `ai job dataset.csv`: Sample dataset used for model training and matching

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python (NLP, ML)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas & NumPy
- Transformers / LLM (e.g., Gemini / BERT / GPT)
- Streamlit (for UI if used)
- Google Colab (for training and testing)

## 📊 Dataset

Includes job descriptions and resume-like input samples.
- Contains fields like: `Job Title`, `Skills Required`, `Experience`, etc.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Upload a resume or input skills.
2. Run the notebook to generate predictions.
3. Recommended jobs will be displayed based on similarity.
